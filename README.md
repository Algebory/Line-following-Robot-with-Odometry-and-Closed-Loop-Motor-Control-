# Line-following-Robot-with-Odometry-and-Closed-Loop-Motor-Control
In this project I will be attempting to design and produce a robot that utilizes Odometry and a Closed-Loop Motor Control to follow a line on a track.
This project will be programmed using #C and the chip i will be using is a ATMEGA164P.
Primary objects consist of designing and characterizing infrared sensors that will enable to bot to detect a line and the robots position on the line, and when the robot approaching any corners and lastly be able to know where the start and finish of the track is.
I will be using a LD93D chip to control the motors with Transmissive Optical Slot Sensor to act as an encoder to feedback to the AVR.
